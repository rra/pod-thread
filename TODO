                          Pod::Thread To-Do List

General:

 * Convert Pod::Thread to use Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser.  This
   will allow fixing the rendering of items that look like numbers but
   should be treated as a description list (such as the INN actsync man
   page under -v).

Test suite:

 * Add basic tests for at least all of the basic thread commands that the
   module may output.

 * Add a test of the syntax of the POD documentation.

 * Add a spelling test, only run when maintainer checks are enabled.

 * Add tests for the various constructor options.
