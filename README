  I welcome all bug reports and patches for this package.  However, please

  I'll save your mail and get to it as soon as I can, but depending on how

BLURB

  Pod::Thread translates POD source into thread, a macro language
  processed by spin.  It supports optionally adding a table of contents
  and a navigation bar to the genenerated file.  This package also
  includes the pod2thread driver script, invoked automatically by spin for
  POD files and pointers to POD files.

DESCRIPTION

  This package contains a module to translate POD into thread, an HTML
  macro language.  As such, it's not very useful without spin, a separate
  program to convert thread into HTML.  spin is available from:

      http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/web/

  and the most recent version of this module will be found on the same
  page.  I wrote this module for my personal needs and it may not be (and
  in fact probably isn't) suitable for more general use as yet.

  The eventual intention is to turn the core portions of spin into a
  second Perl module and add it to this package, which will make this a
  more generally useful package for HTML page generation.  I have no
  estimate as to when I'll get around to doing that.

  The conversion done by this module is mostly straightforward.  The only
  notable parts are a search through the full processed file for a CVS or
  Subversion Id string to pass on to the thread source and the optional
  generation of a table of contents or a navigation bar at the top of the
  generated file.

REQUIREMENTS

  As mentioned above, Pod::Thread is not particularly useful without
  spin.  It also requires Perl 5.006 or later.

INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the "make install" as root.  This will also
  install a driver scripts named pod2thread; see its man page for more
  information.
