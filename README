  I welcome all bug reports and patches for this package.  However, please
  be aware that I tend to be extremely busy and to get a lot of mail.
  I'll save your mail and get to it as soon as I can, but depending on how
  busy I am it may take me a couple of months.


INTRODUCTION

  This package contains a module to translate POD into thread, an HTML
  macro language.  As such, it's not very useful without spin, a separate
  program to convert thread into HTML.  spin is available from:

      <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/web/>

  and the most recent version of this module will be found on the same
  page.  I wrote this module for my personal needs and it may not be (and
  in fact probably isn't) suitable for more general use as yet.

  The eventual intention is to turn the core portions of spin into a
  second Perl module and add it to this package, which will make this a
  more generally useful package for HTML page generation.  I have no
  estimate as to when I'll get around to doing that.


INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  You'll probably need to do the "make install" as root.  This will also
  install a driver scripts named pod2thread; see its man page for more
  information.
