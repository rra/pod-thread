	* bin/pod2thread: Add new stopwords now that Test::Spelling
	ignores any local dictionaries.
	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm: Likewise.

	* tools/lib/Module/Build/SetVersion.pm: New Module::Build subclass
	that handles setting the version number in Perl modules during the
	build process.
	* Build.PL: Use Module::Build::SetVersion.
	* set-version: Delete.

	* Build.PL: New build system using Module::Build.
	* Makefile.PL: Delete.
	* VERSION: Delete.  The version is now set in Build.PL.
	* scripts/pod2thread: Move to...
	* bin/pod2thread: ...here, to match the standard Module::Build
	package layout.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (reformat): Remove single spaces at the start
	of lines in wrapped paragraphs, left behind due to Text::Wrap's
	lack of understanding of two spaces after periods.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (output): Encode the output into UTF-8 if
	necessary.  Fixes ISO 8859-1 non-breaking spaces left behind in
	thread output.

	* scripts/pod2thread (find_headings): Strip formatting codes from
	headings that will go into the table of contents or navbar.  We
	don't have a way to format these, so the formatting codes would
	otherwise be left as literal strings.
	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (cmd_head1): Strip markup from the head1 text
	before seeing if it's mentioned in the table of contents or
	navbar.

	* t/basic.t: Adjust non-numeric item test to force all item tags
	to be non-numeric, required by the current Pod::Simple.

2013-01-05  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 1.00 released.

	* LICENSE: New file summarizing copyright and license information.

	easier to parse.
	* scripts/pod2thread: Likewise.

	* t/strict.t: New test for strict, warning, and compilation of all
	Perl code, and for test suite coverage.  The current coverage
	threshold is set quite low.

	* Makefile.PL: Declare the required version of Perl.  Remove
	File::Spec dependency that's satisfied by that Perl version.
	Declare the package license.

	* set-version: New script to substitute the distribution version
	into the modules that make up the distribution.
	* Makefile.PL: Use set-version as a filter when building modules
	for installation.
	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm: Replace version with 0.0, since it will be
	replaced by set-version.

	* scripts/pod2thread: Add all supported command-line options to
	SYNOPSIS and standardize the formatting.

	* t/synopsis.t: New test for the syntax of SYNOPSIS code.

	of Perl.

	* t/data/perlcriticrc: Test configuration for perlcritic.
	* t/data/perltidyrc: Test configuration for perltidy.

	* Makefile.PL: Remove conditionals on Perl 5.005, since Perl 5.8
	is now required.  Use angle brackets around my email address.
	Update coding style and formatting.

	* scripts/pod2thread: Remove the code to generate the #! line and
	supporting code and instead rely on ExtUtils::MakeMaker to handle
	that during package build.
	* scripts/pod2thread.PL: Renamed to pod2thread.
	* Makefile.PL: Remove PL_FILES and realclean.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm: Largely rewritten to use Pod::Simple and to
	update the coding style.  Now also requires the Readonly module.
	This fixes a long-standing bug in formatting an =item that looks
	numeric but is intended to be text.
	* t/basic.t: Parsers can no longer be used for more than one
	document.  Add new test for text =item that looks numeric.
	* Makefile.PL: Add Readonly to prerequisites and replace
	Pod::Parser with Pod::Simple.

2013-01-04  Russ Allbery  <rra@stanford.edu>

	* t/pod.t: New test for POD syntax.
	* t/pod-spelling.t: New test for spelling in POD documentation.
	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm: Add stopwords.
	* scripts/pod2thread.PL: Likewise.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (seq_l): Only add angle brackets around a URL
	if there was no anchor text.

	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.10 released.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (cmd_head1): Clear IN_NAME at the first =head1
	that isn't NAME rather than leaving it set for the whole document.

	(navbar): Likewise.
	(contents): Use \number instead of \packnumber.

	output the header and title information right away.
	(verbatim): Make sure that verbatim blocks end with two newlines.
	(textblock): For NAME sections, use the id variable if set and
	output the navigation bar or table of contents if requested.

	one-line description.
	(preprocess_paragraph): Search for CVS Id strings only if the id
	variable isn't already set.
	(cmd_head1): Only treat NAME as special if title isn't set, and if
	contents or navbar are set, add target attributes to the top-level

	(seq_l): If contents or navbar are set and the link is to an
	internal section that matches one of our top-level headings, make
	it a real link now that we can.
	(contents): New function.
	(navbar): New function.
	(heading): Handle target attributes.

	* scripts/pod2thread.PL: Add support for -c and -n to set contents
	and navbar variables for Pod::Thread accordingly.  If we have to
	scan the POD file, also look for CVS Id tags and set the id
	variable for Pod::Thread.  Support the -t flag.

	to the documentation.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (preprocess_paragraph): Munge the Id tag in
