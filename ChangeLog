	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.06 released.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (begin_pod): New function.  If title was set,
	output the header and title information right away.
	(verbatim): Make sure that verbatim blocks end with two newlines.
	(textblock): For NAME sections, use the id variable if set and
	output the navigation bar or table of contents if requested.
	Handle multiple comma-separated page names before the dash in the
	one-line description.
	(preprocess_paragraph): Search for CVS Id strings only if the id
	variable isn't already set.
	(cmd_head1): Only treat NAME as special if title isn't set, and if
	contents or navbar are set, add target attributes to the top-level
	headings.
	(seq_l): If contents or navbar are set and the link is to an
	internal section that matches one of our top-level headings, make
	it a real link now that we can.
	(contents): New function.
	(navbar): New function.
	(heading): Handle target attributes.

	* scripts/pod2thread.PL: Add support for -c and -n to set contents
	and navbar variables for Pod::Thread accordingly.  If we have to
	scan the POD file, also look for CVS Id tags and set the id
	variable for Pod::Thread.  Support the -t flag.
	(find_headings): New function, called to find top level headings.

	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.05 released.  Make the package version
	number match the module version.

	* scripts/pod2thread.PL: Add a reference to the package web page
	to the documentation.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm: Strip the entities table down to just
	mappings for entities that don't exist in HTML 4.0.  Add a
	reference to the web page to the documentation.
	(interior_sequence): Pass all entities not found in the stripped
	table along to spin as \entity commands.

	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.03 released.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (preprocess_paragraph): Munge the Id tag in
	the source so that CVS doesn't get too smart.
	(reformat): Don't forcibly break long lines.  It causes bogus
	spaces in the XHTML output of spin.

	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.02 released.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (preprocess_paragraph): Be more conservative
	about what we recognize as an Id tag in the input.
