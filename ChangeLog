	* VERSION: Pod::Thread 0.03 released.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (preprocess_paragraph): Munge the Id tag in
	the source so that CVS doesn't get too smart.

	spaces in the XHTML output of spin.

	* lib/Pod/Thread.pm (preprocess_paragraph): Be more conservative
	about what we recognize as an Id tag in the input.
