blurb: |
  Pod::Thread translates POD source into thread, a macro language processed by
  DocKnot.  It supports optionally adding a table of contents and a navigation
  bar to the genenerated file.  This package also includes the pod2thread
  driver script for easy command-line access to the converter.

description: |
  This package contains a module to translate POD into thread, an HTML macro
  language.  As such, it is primarily intended to support
  [DocKnot](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/docknot/), the static site
  generator that converts thread into HTML.  Pod::Thread provides the POD
  formatting for DocKnot.

  DocKnot and this module were written for my personal needs and may not be
  suitable for more general use.

  The conversion done by this module is mostly straightforward.  The only
  notable parts are the optional generation of a table of contents or a
  navigation bar at the top of the generated file.

requirements: |
  Perl 5.24 or later.  As mentioned above, it's also not particularly useful
  without DocKnot.

test:
  lancaster: true
  suffix: |
    Perl6::Slurp is required by the test suite.  The following additional Perl
    modules will be used by the test suite if present:

    * Devel::Cover
    * Perl::Critic::Freenode
    * Test::CPAN::Changes (part of CPAN-Changes)
    * Test::MinimumVersion
    * Test::Perl::Critic
    * Test::Pod
    * Test::Spelling
    * Test::Strict
    * Test::Synopsis

    All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
    are not available.
